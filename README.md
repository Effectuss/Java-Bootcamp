## Educational process

Bootcamp is an intensive immersion-based learning approach. The results achieved within a few months during a bootcamp are comparable to what would typically take years. The effectiveness of this method lies in fully immersing individuals in the learning process, enabling them to absorb information more rapidly. Currently, this learning approach is actively employed by global companies and educational programs.
